# Tic-tac-toe
My second project on python(2.7)

My second game on Python(2.7). This is a my version of "tic-tac-toe" game. I made it only to get practise in programming on python, and it was rather interesting, hard and fun.
- In this game you can choose the complexity of the game
- –ùou can choose the order of moves
- The bot plays ideally on 100% complexity
- At the end of the game you can see the result and start to play again
